I started as a young ethical hacker back in 2013, it was fun but I decided it was a waste of time, so I entered web development industry. Since then, I have helped small businesses, agencies, and individuals around the world to have an online presence by developing and designing their online platforms.\r\n    <br />\r\n                    <br />\r\n                    For most clients, I mostly use WordPress as I believe it's most often the best fit for my clients. Also being open source, and having a huge community is a huge plus. Other than WordPress, I am a master at 70% of front end technology, specially ReactJs which I used in this portfolio alongside NextJs for serverside rendering.\r\n    <br />\r\n                    <br />\r\n                    Using programs like Photoshop, tweaking a theme, finding edge CSS solutions, add subtle javascript animations, or automating things on the terminal is like second nature for me.\r\n    <br />\r\n                    <br />\r\n                    In my web development journey, I learned from Google's approach to their products that what matters the most for a successful website is a user experience driven design. That's why you will find that all my websites have an unusual beautiful design but still make you feel like you are at home.\r\n    <br />\r\n                    <br />\r\n                    If I am not in front of my beloved computer coding or working on my business, I will probably be learning as my life motto is \"you start dying when you stop learning and improving\".\r\n                </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className=\"box\">\r\n                <h2>TOP SKILLS</h2>\r\n                <Skills />\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className=\"box\">\r\n                <h2>Favorite Tools & Programs</h2>\r\n                <Tools />\r\n            </div>\r\n            <style jsx>{`\r\n                .cont {\r\n                    width: 100%;\r\n                    position: relative;\r\n                    background: #111111b3;\r\n                   backdrop-filter: blur(15px);\r\n                   text-align: center;\r\n                   color: #ffffff;\r\n                }\r\n                h2{\r\n                    margin-top: 6px;\r\n                }\r\n                .box{\r\n                    // border-top: 1px solid #ffffff38;\r\n                    border-bottom: 1px solid #ffffff38;\r\n                    padding: 30px 2%;\r\n                }\r\n                p{\r\n                    width: 900px;\r\n                    max-width: 95%;\r\n                    margin: 27px auto;\r\n                    font-size: 1.2em;\r\n                    color: #ececec;\r\n                    text-align: left;\r\n                    font-family: 'Open Sans',sans-serif;\r\n                }\r\n                @media (max-width: 600px){\r\n                    p{\r\n                        font-size: 1em;\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n            `}</style>\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AAEA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAzBA;AAAA;AAAA;AA6DA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
